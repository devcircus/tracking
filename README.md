### Disclaimer
This skeleton app is used as a base for Laravel apps created for PHPStage. No promises are made about upkeep, versioning, reliability, etc.
It utilizes Jonathan Reinink's [inertiajs](https://github.com/inertiajs) under-the-hood, which is a "Turbolinks inspired library that makes it super easy to create server-driven single-page apps".

## Installation
You can install the skeleton app via composer:

```bash
composer create-project phpcircus/phpstage-skeleton
